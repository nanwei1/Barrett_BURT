Haptic programs for the Barrett Burt dual-arm rehabilitation robot (Unity/C#)

## Haptic World
The haptic world is a modified version of the original haptic demo program by Barrett (https://github.com/BarrettTechnology/barrett-burt-haptics-demo). Changes include:
* Addition of the 2nd RobotConnection and Player objects to allow dual-arm operation.
* Texture rendering on the haptic cube by simulating the surface friction.
* Added haptic touch light and haptic push button that controls a directional light.

Please see the original repo for instructions and license details.
